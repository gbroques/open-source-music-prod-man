## Chapter 1: Music Theory Part 1 - Ocatves, Scales and Modes

* Music naturally gravitates around the root note of the chosen key.
* Dance music can be produced in a majory key, but is more commonly produced in a minor key.

Major Scale Pattern

    Tone – Tone – Semitone – Tone – Tone – Tone – Semitone

Tone - Semitone - Tone - Tone - Semitone - Tone - Tone

C Major

    C – D – E – F – G – A – B – C

To create the minor scale, the major tonal pattern is pushed two to the right.

Minor Scale Pattern

    Tone – Semitone – Tone – Tone – Semitone – Tone – Tone

A Minor

    A – B – C – D – E – F – G – A

All major keys have a relative minor key.

This means that a key in both minor and major will contain the exact same notes, just starting with a different root note.

A Minor is the relative minor key of C Major.

This major to minor relationship offers the composer the opportunity to move, or modulate, between the two different keys during a composition to add more interest to a musical piece.

You can quickly calculate the relative minor of any major key by taking the sixth note of the major key and playing the minor key starting on that note.

The minor scale consists of three different scales:

1. Natural Minor Scale
2. Harmonic Minor Scale
3. Melodic Minor Scale

Harmonic minor scale is the same as the natural minor scale but with the seventh note increased by a semitone for more natural and powerful sounding chord progressions.

In the melodic minor scale, both the sixth and the seventh notes of the natural minor are raised by a semitone each when ascending up the scale, but when descending the scale, it returns to using the natural minor scale.

It's generally accepted that if you choose to write in a minor key, it’s best to use the notes in melodic minor for all instruments with the exception of any chords or chord progressions whereby it is best to use the harmonic minor for these.

Most dance records are written in A minor, D minor or E minor.

Indeed, in a recent examination of over a thousand dance records from the past 5 years, more than 42% were written in A minor. A further 21% were in D minor, 16% in E minor, while the rest were a combination of C minor, E b minor, F# minor, C# minor, G minor, Db minor and their major relatives, in descending order.

The most influential and powerful area for dance music’s bass reproduction on a club speaker system is 50 to 65 Hz, and the root note of A1 sits at 55 Hz. Since the music will naturally modulate or gravitate around the root note in your chosen key, having the root note of the music at 55 Hz will help to maintain the bass ‘groove’ energy of the record at a particularly useful frequency.

## CONSTRUCTING MELODIES

Almost all genres today rely on numerous motifs interacting poly-rhythmically with one another.

A motif is a short rhythmical idea that provides listeners with a reference point for the track.

Motifs follow similar guidelines to the way that we ask and then answer a question. In a motif, the first musical phrase often applies the question that is then 'answered' by the second phrase. This type of arrangement is known as a 'binary phrase' and plays an important role in almost all club-based tracks.

There are three essential elements to creating any motif:

1. simplicity
2. rhythmical repetition
3. and small variations.

When it comes to creating a motif, it is generally easiest to compose the rhythmical content first using a single pitch and then move onto introducing pitch changes between phrases at a later stage.

A general benchmark to a memorable motif is the ability to hum it.
